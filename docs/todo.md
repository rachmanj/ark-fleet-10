# Current Tasks

## üî¥ Critical Priority (P0)

### [ ] P0: Fix Database Configuration Mismatch
**Context**: Application connected to wrong database
- **Issue**: Codebase expects `arkfleet_db` but `.env` points to `genaf_db` (different system)
- **Impact**: Application completely non-functional, all queries fail
- **Files**: `.env`, `config/database.php`
- **Tables Missing**: equipments, movings, documents, projects, etc.
- **Action Required**:
  1. Create database: `CREATE DATABASE arkfleet_db;`
  2. Update `.env`: `DB_DATABASE=arkfleet_db`
  3. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
  4. Run seeders: `php artisan db:seed` (if seeders exist)
  5. Test application at `http://localhost:8000`
- **Blocker**: Cannot test any functionality until resolved
- **Ref**: See MEMORY.md #001, docs/architecture.md

---

## High Priority (P1)

### [ ] P1: Verify Application Deployment Environment
**Context**: Need to confirm application running state and environment
- **Check Items**:
  - Is `php artisan serve` running on port 8000?
  - Is database server accessible?
  - Are migrations run successfully?
  - Can login page be accessed?
  - Do test credentials work?
- **Files**: `.env.example` (if exists), database seeders
- **Dependencies**: Blocked by P0 database fix

### [ ] P1: Create Database Seeders
**Context**: Fresh database needs initial data
- **Required Seeders**:
  - RoleSeeder (admin, manager, user roles)
  - DepartmentSeeder (organizational units)
  - PlantTypeSeeder (equipment types)
  - PlantGroupSeeder (equipment sub-categories)
  - UnitstatusSeeder (Active, Inactive, Under Repair, Disposed)
  - AssetCategorySeeder (Major, Minor)
  - DocumentTypeSeeder (BPKB, STNK, POLIS, PO)
  - UserSeeder (test admin user)
- **Files**: `database/seeders/` directory
- **Note**: DepartmentSeeder and RoleSeeder already exist (check implementation)

### [ ] P1: Test Critical User Flows
**Context**: Verify core functionality works after database setup
- **Test Flows**:
  1. User login/logout
  2. Equipment creation and listing
  3. Equipment transfer (Moving/IPA) process
  4. Document creation and expiry alerts
  5. Report generation (Summary IPA, Active Status)
  6. Excel export functionality
- **Use**: Browser automation at `http://localhost:8000`
- **Dependencies**: Blocked by P0 and seeded data

---

## Medium Priority (P2)

### [ ] P2: Improve Cart Concurrency Safety
**Context**: Equipment cart for transfers has no user isolation
- **Issue**: `cart_flag` field on equipment table shared globally
- **Risk**: Two users creating transfers simultaneously could interfere
- **Solutions**:
  - Option A: Add `user_id` and `session_id` to cart flag value
  - Option B: Create separate `cart_items` table with user isolation
  - Option C: Use Laravel session for cart storage
- **Files**: `app/Models/Equipment.php`, migrations, `MovingDetailController.php`
- **Ref**: MEMORY.md #006, docs/decisions.md "Cart Pattern Decision"

### [ ] P2: Implement Automated Activity Logging
**Context**: Manual logging in controllers is error-prone
- **Current**: Controllers manually call `LoggerController::store()`
- **Problem**: Easy to forget, inconsistent, not standardized
- **Solution**: Laravel Events and Listeners
  - Create events: EquipmentCreated, EquipmentUpdated, MovingCreated, etc.
  - Create listener: ActivityLogger
  - Dispatch events in models using model events
- **Files**: `app/Events/`, `app/Listeners/`, model boot methods
- **Ref**: MEMORY.md #009

### [ ] P2: Add Basic Test Coverage
**Context**: Application has only example tests
- **Priority Tests**:
  - Feature: Equipment CRUD operations
  - Feature: Moving/Transfer creation
  - Feature: Document expiry calculation
  - Unit: Equipment model relationships
  - Unit: Document extension logic
- **Files**: `tests/Feature/EquipmentTest.php`, etc.
- **Goal**: 50%+ coverage of critical paths

### [ ] P2: Create .env.example File
**Context**: No .env.example for new developers
- **Content**:
  - Database settings for arkfleet_db
  - Mail configuration placeholders
  - App name: ARKFleet
  - Timezone: Asia/Singapore (per user memory)
  - Debug settings
  - Key structure (APP_KEY=)
- **File**: `.env.example`

---

## Low Priority (P3)

### [ ] P3: Enhance Error Handling
**Context**: Improve user experience during errors
- **Areas**:
  - Catch database connection errors gracefully
  - Validate file uploads (equipment photos, document attachments)
  - Better error messages for validation failures
  - Handle soft-deleted document edge cases
- **Files**: Controllers, validation requests, exception handler

### [ ] P3: Add API Documentation
**Context**: Minimal API exists but no documentation
- **Current APIs**:
  - GET /api/equipments
  - GET /api/projects
- **Tools**: Scribe or Swagger
- **Benefit**: If API expanded in future, documentation ready

### [ ] P3: Optimize Database Queries
**Context**: Review for N+1 query issues
- **Check**:
  - Equipment list with relationships
  - Moving list with project names
  - Document list with equipment and types
- **Solution**: Add eager loading with `with()`
- **Files**: Controllers using Eloquent queries

### [ ] P3: Add Request Validation Classes
**Context**: Some controllers use inline validation
- **Action**: Extract to Form Request classes
  - `StoreEquipmentRequest` (already exists)
  - `UpdateEquipmentRequest`
  - `StoreMovingRequest`
  - `StoreDocumentRequest`
- **Benefit**: Cleaner controllers, reusable validation

## Quick Notes

### Database Status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Application expects `arkfleet_db` but connected to `genaf_db`
- Current database has 3 users, 3 vehicles, 0 equipment (wrong schema)
- Migrations not run on correct database
- Application will not work until database issue resolved

### Development Environment
- **Server**: Assumed running at `http://localhost:8000`
- **OS**: Windows 10 (build 26200)
- **Shell**: PowerShell
- **Timezone Preference**: Asia/Singapore
- **Laravel Version**: 10.x (not 11/12 per user preference - see decisions.md)

### Code Quality Observations
- ‚úÖ Consistent patterns across modules
- ‚úÖ Good relationship modeling with withDefault()
- ‚úÖ Automatic audit trail via model events
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Minimal test coverage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual activity logging (should be automated)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No API documentation

### Next Developer Onboarding Steps
1. Fix database connection (P0 task)
2. Read `docs/architecture.md` for system overview
3. Read `docs/decisions.md` to understand architectural choices
4. Review `MEMORY.md` for known issues and patterns
5. Run seeders to populate master data
6. Test application with browser automation
7. Review open tasks in this file

### Known Limitations
- Cart system has no user isolation (concurrent usage risk)
- No mobile app support (web-only)
- Limited API layer
- Document renewal limited to single chain (not multi-level versioning)

### Documentation Health
- ‚úÖ Architecture documentation: Comprehensive and current
- ‚úÖ Decision records: Well documented with rationale
- ‚úÖ Memory entries: Detailed with actionable insights
- ‚úÖ TODO tracking: This file (current)
- üîÑ Backlog: Needs updating with improvement ideas
- ‚ùå README: Still default Laravel README (needs replacement)
